    <h3><p>1.What is react.js ? it is basically a combination of two languages HTML and JavaScript. 
    <b>Commands for React.js: </b>
        some of the basic tags are view,button,text,style,import etc.
    
    So now how to use these commands . Below there is a small example of what you can create using these normal tags . so now click on the example . Dont worry if you find it difficult . i will explain it line by line .
In first line you can see its the import command . this command will download the file react and name and save it as React. in the 2nd line we are importing button view and text from the file react-native .
     In next line there is a class export default which extends component this means that export default will have the same properties as that of componet . This is called inheritance . whatever you write in  render will be displayed on screen .
      it is used with return command so that after it has presented it returns to zero . then in view tag there is style command and a flex command  through which we can create flex containers which is used to style the page .
       by this command you divide your screen into separate parts and style it . then bordercolor command is to give border a color and border width to give border a width . text command is if you want to write anything in these flex containers
